# Architecture Goals


1. **Modularity**: The system is divided into separate, well-defined modules or components, each responsible for a specific aspect of functionality. This allows for easier understanding, maintenance, and modification of the system.

2. **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**: Different parts of the system handle different concerns, such as presentation, business logic, and data storage, without overlapping responsibilities. This enhances maintainability and reduces the risk of unintended side effects.

3. **Abstraction**: The architecture abstracts away implementation details, exposing only essential interfaces and hiding unnecessary complexity. This makes the system easier to comprehend and reduces dependencies between components.

4. **Encapsulation**: Components are encapsulated, meaning their internal workings are hidden and accessed only through well-defined interfaces. This prevents unauthorized access and limits the impact of changes to the component's implementation.

5. **Scalability**: The architecture is designed to accommodate growth and changes in requirements without requiring extensive rework. This involves designing components to be loosely coupled and easily replaceable.

6. **Testability**: The architecture facilitates testing at various levels, including unit tests for individual components, integration tests for interactions between components, and system tests to verify end-to-end functionality. This ensures the reliability and correctness of the software.

7. **Readability and Maintainability**: The architecture prioritizes clarity and simplicity in design, making it easier for developers to understand and modify the codebase over time. This includes consistent naming conventions, code organization, and documentation.

8. **Performance**: While cleanliness often prioritizes simplicity over optimization, a clean architecture should still consider performance implications and avoid unnecessary overhead. This involves appropriate data structures, algorithms, and design patterns to achieve acceptable performance levels.

9. **Flexibility**: The architecture allows for changes and adaptations to requirements with minimal effort. This may involve using design patterns such as Dependency Injection to decouple components and facilitate configuration changes.

10. **Adherence to Design Principles**: A clean architecture typically adheres to well-established design principles such as SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid). These principles help ensure a maintainable, extensible, and robust software system.

By embodying these properties, a clean architecture promotes sustainability, agility, and quality in frontend development, making it easier to build, maintain, and evolve software systems over time.
